"""
Weighted provider‑selection strategies.

This module implements two concrete strategies that can be used by the
router to pick a provider for a given model request:

* :class:`WeightedStrategy` – selects a provider according to static
  weights supplied in the provider configuration.  The selection is
  deterministic: a per‑model usage counter is used to generate a
  pseudo‑random offset, ensuring that the long‑term selection frequencies
  converge to the configured weights without relying on the global random
  generator.

* :class:`DynamicWeightedStrategy` – extends :class:`WeightedStrategy` by
  allowing the weights to be changed at runtime and by recording the
  latency (time interval) between successive selections of the same
  provider.  The recorded latencies can be accessed via
  :meth:`DynamicWeightedStrategy.get_latency_history` for further analysis
  or adaptive routing decisions.

Both strategies conform to the :class:`~llm_router_api.base.lb.strategy.ChooseProviderStrategyI`
interface.

class WeightedStrategy(ChooseProviderStrategyI):
    """
    Provider‑selection strategy based on static, normalized weights.

    The strategy interprets the ``weight`` field of each provider
    configuration as a probability weight in the range ``[0, 1]``.  If a
    configuration omits the field, a default weight of ``1.0`` is used.
    Weights less than or equal to zero are treated as ``0`` and the
    corresponding provider will never be selected.

    Selection is performed without external randomness.  A deterministic
    offset derived from a per‑model usage counter is used to traverse the
    cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normalized weights,
    guaranteeing that over many calls the observed frequencies converge to
    the configured probabilities.
